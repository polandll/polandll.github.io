<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have defined your queries, you’re ready to begin designing
Cassandra tables. First, create a logical model containing a table for
each query, capturing entities and relationships from the conceptual
model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To name each table, you’ll identify the primary entity type for which
you are querying and use that to start the entity name. If you are
querying by attributes of other related entities, append those to the
table name, separated with <code><em>by</em></code>. For example, <code>hotels_by_poi</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you identify the primary key for the table, adding partition key
columns based on the required query attributes, and clustering columns
in order to guarantee uniqueness and support desired sort ordering.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of the primary key is extremely important, as it will
determine how much data will be stored in each partition and how that
data is organized on disk, which in turn will affect how quickly
Cassandra processes reads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Complete each table by adding any additional attributes identified by
the query. If any of these additional attributes are the same for every
instance of the partition key, mark the column as static.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that was a pretty quick description of a fairly involved process, so
it will be worthwhile to work through a detailed example. First, let’s
introduce a notation that you can use to represent logical models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several individuals within the Cassandra community have proposed
notations for capturing data models in diagrammatic form. This document
uses a notation popularized by Artem Chebotko which provides a simple,
informative way to visualize the relationships between queries and
tables in your designs. This figure shows the Chebotko notation for a
logical data model.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each table is shown with its title and a list of columns. Primary key
columns are identified via symbols such as <strong>K</strong> for partition key columns
and <strong>C</strong>↑ or <strong>C</strong>↓ to represent clustering columns. Lines are shown
entering tables or between tables to indicate the queries that each
table is designed to support.</p>

<h2 id="hotel-logical-data-model"><a class="anchor" href="#hotel-logical-data-model"></a>Hotel Logical Data Model</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The figure below shows a Chebotko logical data model for the queries
involving hotels, points of interest, rooms, and amenities. One thing
you&#8217;ll notice immediately is that the Cassandra design doesn’t include
dedicated tables for rooms or amenities, as you had in the relational
design. This is because the workflow didn’t identify any queries
requiring this direct access.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../_images/data_modeling_hotel_logical.png" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s explore the details of each of these tables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first query Q1 is to find hotels near a point of interest, so you’ll
call this table <code>hotels_by_poi</code>. Searching by a named point of interest
is a clue that the point of interest should be a part of the primary
key. Let’s reference the point of interest by name, because according to
the workflow that is how users will start their search.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll note that you certainly could have more than one hotel near a
given point of interest, so you’ll need another component in the primary
key in order to make sure you have a unique partition for each hotel. So
you add the hotel key as a clustering column.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important consideration in designing your table’s primary key is
making sure that it defines a unique data element. Otherwise you run the
risk of accidentally overwriting data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now for the second query (Q2), you’ll need a table to get information
about a specific hotel. One approach would have been to put all of the
attributes of a hotel in the <code>hotels_by_poi</code> table, but you added only
those attributes that were required by the application workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the workflow diagram, you know that the <code>hotels_by_poi</code> table is
used to display a list of hotels with basic information on each hotel,
and the application knows the unique identifiers of the hotels returned.
When the user selects a hotel to view details, you can then use Q2,
which is used to obtain details about the hotel. Because you already
have the <code>hotel_id</code> from Q1, you use that as a reference to the hotel
you’re looking for. Therefore the second table is just called <code>hotels</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another option would have been to store a set of <code>poi_names</code> in the
hotels table. This is an equally valid approach. You’ll learn through
experience which approach is best for your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Q3 is just a reverse of Q1—looking for points of interest near a hotel,
rather than hotels near a point of interest. This time, however, you
need to access the details of each point of interest, as represented by
the <code>pois_by_hotel</code> table. As previously, you add the point of interest
name as a clustering key to guarantee uniqueness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, let’s now consider how to support query Q4 to help the
user find available rooms at a selected hotel for the nights they are
interested in staying. Note that this query involves both a start date
and an end date. Because you’re querying over a range instead of a
single date, you know that you’ll need to use the date as a clustering
key. Use the <code>hotel_id</code> as a primary key to group room data for each
hotel on a single partition, which should help searches be super fast.
Let’s call this the <code>available_rooms_by_hotel_date</code> table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support searching over a range, use <code>clustering columns
&lt;clustering-columns&gt;</code> to store attributes that you need to access in a
range query. Remember that the order of the clustering columns is
important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of the <code>available_rooms_by_hotel_date</code> table is an instance
of the <strong>wide partition</strong> pattern. This pattern is sometimes called the
<strong>wide row</strong> pattern when discussing databases that support similar
models, but wide partition is a more accurate description from a
Cassandra perspective. The essence of the pattern is to group multiple
related rows in a partition in order to support fast access to multiple
rows within the partition in a single query.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to round out the shopping portion of the data model, add the
<code>amenities_by_room</code> table to support Q5. This will allow users to view
the amenities of one of the rooms that is available for the desired stay
dates.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="reservation-logical-data-model"><a class="anchor" href="#reservation-logical-data-model"></a>Reservation Logical Data Model</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s switch gears to look at the reservation queries. The figure
shows a logical data model for reservations. You’ll notice that these
tables represent a denormalized design; the same data appears in
multiple tables, with differing keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../_images/data_modeling_reservation_logical.png" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to satisfy Q6, the <code>reservations_by_guest</code> table can be used to
look up the reservation by guest name. You could envision query Q7 being
used on behalf of a guest on a self-serve website or a call center agent
trying to assist the guest. Because the guest name might not be unique,
you include the guest ID here as a clustering column as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Q8 and Q9 in particular help to remind you to create queries that
support various stakeholders of the application, not just customers but
staff as well, and perhaps even the analytics team, suppliers, and so
on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hotel staff might wish to see a record of upcoming reservations by
date in order to get insight into how the hotel is performing, such as
what dates the hotel is sold out or undersold. Q8 supports the retrieval
of reservations for a given hotel by date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you create a <code>guests</code> table. This provides a single location
that used to store guest information. In this case, you specify a
separate unique identifier for guest records, as it is not uncommon for
guests to have the same name. In many organizations, a customer database
such as the <code>guests</code> table would be part of a separate customer
management application, which is why other guest access patterns were
omitted from the example.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="patterns-and-anti-patterns"><a class="anchor" href="#patterns-and-anti-patterns"></a>Patterns and Anti-Patterns</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with other types of software design, there are some well-known
patterns and anti-patterns for data modeling in Cassandra. You’ve
already used one of the most common patterns in this hotel model—the
wide partition pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>time series</strong> pattern is an extension of the wide partition pattern.
In this pattern, a series of measurements at specific time intervals are
stored in a wide partition, where the measurement time is used as part
of the partition key. This pattern is frequently used in domains
including business analysis, sensor data management, and scientific
experiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time series pattern is also useful for data other than measurements.
Consider the example of a banking application. You could store each
customer’s balance in a row, but that might lead to a lot of read and
write contention as various customers check their balance or make
transactions. You’d probably be tempted to wrap a transaction around
writes just to protect the balance from being updated in error. In
contrast, a time series–style design would store each transaction as a
timestamped row and leave the work of calculating the current balance to
the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One design trap that many new users fall into is attempting to use
Cassandra as a queue. Each item in the queue is stored with a timestamp
in a wide partition. Items are appended to the end of the queue and read
from the front, being deleted after they are read. This is a design that
seems attractive, especially given its apparent similarity to the time
series pattern. The problem with this approach is that the deleted items
are now <code>tombstones &lt;asynch-deletes&gt;</code> that Cassandra must scan past in
order to read from the front of the queue. Over time, a growing number
of tombstones begins to degrade read performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The queue anti-pattern serves as a reminder that any design that relies
on the deletion of data is potentially a poorly performing design.</p>
